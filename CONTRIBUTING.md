# Contributing to prism-faas

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! prism-faas is a command-line tool by [Prism Protocol](https://github.com/krishyaa06) — Prism FaaS is a serverless function orchestrator: versioned function registry, MicroVM placement with best-fit bin packing and LRU eviction, warm pools with keep-alive, cold start vs snapshot-restore modelling, predictive pre-warming, tenant token-bucket and concurrency quotas, 429 throttling, GB-second billing and isolated handler execution.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishyaa06/prism-faas.git
cd prism-faas
npm start
```

## Before you open a pull request

Make sure everything passes locally:

```bash
npm test
```

## Guidelines

- **Zero dependencies.** Please don't add runtime dependencies — use Node.js built-ins (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:test`, …).
- **No build step, no frameworks.** Keep it plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript so it runs straight from GitHub Pages.
- **Everything stays in the browser.** Don't send user data to any server.
- Keep pull requests small and focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Update the README when you change behaviour, flags or options.
